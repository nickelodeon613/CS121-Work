Some Background Information
------------------------------

### **Where I am from**

I was born and raised in [Chicago, Illinois](http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/533218_269692296469361_1865806730_n.jpg) My grandparents from both sides moved to Chicago in the 70s and have resided there since. A fun fact about me is that I am quite a Latin American mix because of this. I am Guatemalan, Costa Rican, and Peruvian. I have quite a large family especially with two stepfamilies. All together I have 6 siblings and all of us are years apart from each other. For example, my two [youngest siblings](http://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/5546_10152927175095444_597874557_n.jpg) are 10 (turning 11 next week) and a one year old.

### **Education and Future Plans**

I went to a Chicago Public High School called Northside College Prep and now I am at Macalester College. I am currently pre med majoring in Neuroscience with a concentration in Psychology and a minor in Biology. But then again, I am only a sophomore things are bound to change at least a little bit. And after Mac, we will see what the world has planned for me.
