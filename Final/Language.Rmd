```{r}
require(mosaic)
fetchData("COMP121/word-hints.R")

Spanish

letterProportion <- function(words){
  maybe <- unlist(Spanish)
  letters <- names(Spanish)
  props <- names(maybe)
  newlet <- strsplit(letters, split=TRUE)
  newprops <- strsplit(props,split=TRUE)
  
  possibly <- strsplit(props, split=TRUE, fixed=FALSE)
  return(possibly)
  }
```
```{r}
#lies ok so this is how i would theoretically do this 

letterProportion <- function(x){
  maybe <- tolower(table(unlist(strsplit(x, split=TRUE))))
  amountlet <- nchar(x)
  lp <- amountlet/x

```

##SO I couldn't get this to this to work... I realized (what I have written above) was me tryig to do the whole thing instead of number one because I accidently read it wrong. However, theoretically for number one if I could get it to work I would just get the number of characters in the string and divide it by the length of the character string through nchar.
